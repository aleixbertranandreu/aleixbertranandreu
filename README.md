# Aleix - Developer | Hacker | Tech Enthusiast üë®‚Äçüíª

## About Me

Hi, I'm Aleix, a second-year computer science student with a strong passion for coding, problem-solving, and hacking (ethically, of course). I'm constantly learning and evolving, focusing on algorithms, system-level programming, and security. My goal is to always push the limits of what's possible with technology and to stay ahead of the curve in this fast-paced world.

I enjoy tackling complex challenges, whether it‚Äôs optimizing an algorithm, developing a robust system, or exploring the world of ethical hacking. I‚Äôm always up for learning new languages and tools, and I thrive in environments where I can experiment and grow.
